19. Shenandoah National Park
```
[verse]
Autumn leaves fall in slow motion
Shenandoah's rivers sing their song
Through the Blue Ridge mountains' embrace
Whispers of history in every place

[verse]
Cedar trees sway with gentle grace
Echoes of Civil War's lost race
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant hues
A symphony of nature's views

[chorus]
Let the music flow like the Shenandoah's stream
In this jazz-filled air, we're all a dream
Of mountains tall and valleys deep
Where every note is softly steeped

[verse]
Hikers tread on ancient trails
Where eagles soar through autumn sails
The wind carries a saxophone
A melody that's never done

[bridge]
Beneath the stars, the night is bright
With jazz and fire in the night
Shenandoah's heart beats true
In every chord we play for you

[verse]
Moonlight dances on the lake
A jazz band plays with gentle shake
The park sleeps in peaceful tune
As dawn breaks through the morning moon
```
20. Mount Rainier National Park
```
[verse]
Volcanic peaks rise in the mist
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant lists
Rainshadow valleys hold their breath
Echoes of glaciers in the depth

[verse]
Cascading waterfalls cascade
Through ancient forests, time has made
A symphony of nature's art
Where eagles soar and spirits start

[chorus]
Let the rhythm of the rain
Guide your steps through mountain veins
In this jazz of earth and sky
Mount Rainier touches the high

[verse]
Snow-capped summits kiss the clouds
Whispers of the wind's proud sounds
Every trail a story told
In this park, we're bold and gold

[bridge]
Steam rises from volcanic breath
A dance of fire and mountain depth
Timeless echoes in the air
Jazz flows through the atmosphere

[verse]
Sunset hues paint the terrain
Where wildflowers sway with rain
Mount Rainier's soul takes flight
In every note, we find our right
```
21. Big Bend National Park
```
[verse]
Desert winds whisper through the canyon's embrace
Rio Grande flows with a timeless grace
Sunset hues paint the sky in gold
Big Bend's secrets, stories untold

[chorus]
In this land where the desert meets the sky
Echoes of ancient rivers pass by
Under starlit skies we sway and sing
Big Bend's rhythm, forever our spring

[verse]
Rattlesnakes dance in the twilight's glow
Canyon walls hold a thousand stories below
Every step through the brush and stone
Reveals a world that's all its own

[bridge]
The desert breathes with a slow refrain
A symphony of silence, a whisper of rain
In this vastness where the wild runs free
Big Bend's spirit lives in you and me

[verse]
Night falls on the desert's wide expanse
Under constellations that never cease to dance
With every note, we find our way
Through Big Bend's endless, winding day

[outro]
So let the desert sing its song
In Big Bend, where we belong
```
22. Joshua Tree National Park
```
[verse]
Desert winds whisper through the rocks
Joshua trees reach for the sky's cloak
Sandy paths where shadows play
Underneath a starry display

[chorus]
Jazz in the canyon, rhythms of stone
Echoes of desert songs
In this dance of earth and sound
We find our way, we're never bound

[verse]
Cacti bloom with silent grace
Sunset hues across the place
Every step a melody
In this land of wild harmony

[bridge]
Moonlight paints the dunes in gold
Stories told by nature's bold
Jazz flows where the rivers run
Through the heart of Joshua's sun

[verse]
Night falls, the silence grows
Whispers of ancient winds that blow
Every note a desert tune
In this place, we're one and done

[outro]
Let the jazz carry us far
Through the desert's timeless star
Joshua Tree, our song remains
A melody through the canyon chains
```
23. Lassen Volcanic National Park
```
[verse]
Ash and steam rise from the ground,
Lassen's peaks in silent sound.
Magma whispers through the trees,
A symphony of molten breeze.

[verse]
Geysers sing in rhythmic flow,
Steam vents pulse with ancient glow.
Volcanic rocks in layered tales,
Echoes of the earth's wild tales.

[chorus]
Let the lava flow, let it play,
In Lassen's heart we find our way.
Through the pines and sulfur skies,
Jazz the land where fire lies.

[verse]
Rivers carve through basalt stone,
Molten rivers in full tone.
Steam rises with a groovy tune,
Lassen's rhythm, bold and new.

[bridge]
Cinder cones in silent dance,
Ash falls soft on mountain trance.
A jazz of earth, a fiery rhyme,
In Lassen's soul we find our time.

[outro]
Let the lava sing its song,
Through the valleys, through the strong.
Lassen's jazz, a volcanic tune,
Echoes forever, under the moon.
```
24. Redwood National Park
```
[verse]
Towering giants in ancient groves
Whispers echo through the leaves
Redwoods stand with silent pride
Guardians of the forest's side

[chorus]
In the heart of Redwood's embrace
Where the fog rolls in a gentle place
Every shadow tells a tale
Of the earth's enduring trail

[verse]
Sunlight filters through the boughs
A symphony of rustling vows
Timeless trees with roots so deep
Hold the secrets that they keep

[bridge]
Beneath the canopy's soft glow
Stories of the past will flow
In every leaf, a history
Of nature's wild harmony

[verse]
Mist ascends in morning light
A dance of shadows, pure and bright
The forest hums with ancient song
Where the redwoods belong

[outro]
So let the winds carry your name
Through the Redwood's sacred frame
In every breath, a lasting rhyme
Of the earth's eternal time
```
25. Capitol Reef National Park
```
[verse]
Red rocks rise in silent dance,
Echoes of the Colorado's trance,
Canyons carve through ancient stone,
In Capitol Reef, we're all alone.

[verse]
Sunlight glows on desert trails,
Whispers of the wind's tales,
Every step a story told,
In this land where legends fold.

[chorus]
Let the rhythm of the canyon flow,
Through the heart of red rock glow,
In this place where time stands still,
Capitol Reef, we're one with will.

[verse]
Horseback rides through rugged paths,
Under stars that guide our paths,
Every shadow tells a tale,
Of the desert's wild and pale.

[bridge]
Voices rise in harmony,
Lost in echoes of the scenery,
Timeless tales beneath the skies,
In Capitol Reef, we find our cries.

[verse]
Sunset paints the canyon's face,
A tapestry of time and space,
In this land where dreams take flight,
Capitol Reef holds the night.
```
26. Theodore Roosevelt National Park
```
[verse]
Beneath the pines where shadows play
Elders whisper tales of yesterday
Buffalo trails through ancient stone
Echoes of a wild, untamed throne

[chorus]
Swing low, let the rhythm flow
Through Roosevelt's rugged glow
Jazz in the wind, a saxophone cry
In this park, the earth and sky

[verse]
Rivers carve through red rock walls
Where bison roam and eagles call
A symphony of nature's might
In every step, a jazz-like fight

[bridge]
Trumpet calls from distant peaks
Where Roosevelt's legacy speaks
Of preservation, bold and true
A melody that time renews

[verse]
Sunrise paints the canyon's face
With hues of gold and crimson grace
A saxophone's smooth refrain
In this park, the wild remains

[outro]
Let the jazz of nature play
Through Roosevelt's enduring way
In every note, a story told
Of wilderness, both bold and old

10. Everglades National Park
```
[verse]
Mangrove shadows sway and bend
In the swamp where the alligators mend
The rhythm of the wetland's breath
Echoes through the cypress teeth

[chorus]
Swing low, let the waters flow
Through the marsh where the herons go
Beneath the moon's silver glow
We dance in the Everglades' slow

[verse]
Cattails whisper secrets deep
Where the egrets wade and sleep
The boardwalks hum a lullaby
Under stars that never die

[bridge]
A swampy groove, a syncopated beat
The Florida Keys in a jazzman's feet
Bassline thrum of the peat bog's song
In the Everglades, we're all wrong

[outro]
Let the glades swing on and on
In the rhythm of the swamp's own
Where the jazz meets the mangrove's tone
We sway with the Everglades' home
```
11. Glacier National Park
```
[verse]
Alpine peaks touch the sky so high,
Glacier's beauty in morning light.
Frosted pines whisper ancient tales,
Echoes of glaciers through the valleys.

[chorus]
Jazz notes rise with the mountain breeze,
A melody that sets you free.
In Glacier's arms, we find our way,
Where wildflowers dance in May.

[verse]
Mist rolls over Lake McDonald's shore,
Reflections shimmer on the floor.
Bighorn sheep climb the rugged trails,
Their stories etched in stone and tales.

[bridge]
The Going-to-the-Sun Road sings,
A symphony of rock and springs.
Jazz hands reach for the sky so high,
In Glacier's heart, we learn to fly.

[chorus]
Jazz notes rise with the mountain breeze,
A melody that sets you free.
In Glacier's arms, we find our way,
Where wildflowers dance in May.

[outro]
So let the jazz of nature play,
In Glacier's embrace, we'll stay.
```
12. Haleakala National Park
```
[verse]
Misty peaks rise at dawn's first light
Haleakala's breath in morning white
Volcanic whispers echo deep
Where stars meet ocean, dreams we keep

[chorus]
Sway with the rhythm of the breeze
In Haleakala's embrace, we find peace
Underneath the Milky Way's glow
This island's heartbeat lets us flow

[verse]
Crater's edge where shadows dance
With every step, a sacred chance
To walk through fire and ancient stone
Where legends live in every tone

[bridge]
Sunrise paints the sky in gold
A celestial tale we all unfold
In this moment, time stands still
Haleakala's magic makes us thrill

[chorus]
Sway with the rhythm of the breeze
In Haleakala's embrace, we find peace
Underneath the Milky Way's glow
This island's heartbeat lets us flow

[outro]
Let the volcanoes sing their song
In Haleakala's arms, we belong
```
13. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
```
[verse]
Lava flows like jazz improvisations
Molten rhythms pulse through the night
Volcanic whispers echo deep
In the heart of Hawaii's fire

[chorus]
Feel the heat, let it rise
Jazz in the air, a fiery surprise
Hawaii's soul, a volcanic cry
In every note, we touch the sky

[verse]
Steam rises from the earth's embrace
A symphony of molten grace
Each eruption, a drumbeat loud
In this land where fire is found

[bridge]
Beneath the stars, the lava flows
Jazz and magma in perfect throes
The island sings with ancient might
A melody that never dies

[verse]
Canyons deep with stories told
Of eruptions past, of legends bold
Each rock a note, each cliff a line
In Hawaii's volcanic design

[outro]
So let the lava flow, let the jazz be heard
In every pulse, in every word
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
Where fire and music never part
```
14. Denali National Park
```
[verse]
Beneath the stars, the mountains rise
A symphony of snow and skies
Denali's peak, a silent cry
In the heart of Alaska's wild

[chorus]
Let the wind sing through the pines
Echoes of the northern lines
Denali's soul, a frozen rhyme
In every note, we find our time

[verse]
Snow-capped peaks touch the heavens high
A dance of shadows in the sky
Wildlife roams where silence lies
In the land of endless blue

[bridge]
Auroras shimmer, lights so bright
Guiding bears through the night
Timeless tales beneath the moon
Denali's song is never done

[verse]
Glaciers carve through ancient stone
Whispers of a world unknown
Every step, a story told
In this land where legends bold

[chorus]
Let the wind sing through the pines
Echoes of the northern lines
Denali's soul, a frozen rhyme
In every note, we find our time
```
15. Olympic National Park
```
[verse]
Tides crash on rugged shores
Forests whisper ancient lore
Mountains rise in silent pride
Olympic's spirit never dies

[verse]
Rainforests breathe with life
Deer graze in misty strife
Eagles soar above the trees
Where wild and free we find our peace

[chorus]
In Olympic's embrace we stand
With every step, a new command
To cherish nature's grand design
And walk through trails of purest shine

[verse]
Storms brew on distant peaks
Thunder echoes in the lakes
Every drop a sacred song
Of earth and sky where we belong

[bridge]
Whales sing in deep blue waves
While bears roam through forest caves
Timeless tales in every breeze
Olympic's heart is wild and free

[verse]
Sunrise paints the mountain side
With colors bold, with dreams aligned
In Olympic's boundless grace
We find our place in nature's face
```
16. Badlands National Park
```
[verse]
Canyons carve through ancient stone
Whispers of the prairie's throne
Eagles soar on winds that moan
Echoes of a wild unknown

[verse]
Bison roam where grasses sway
Footprints etched in time's decay
Rivers carve their winding way
Through the heart of Badlands' gray

[chorus]
In the rhythm of the plains we ride
Where the earth and sky collide
Jazz of nature, deep and wide
Badlands sing with soul and pride

[verse]
Sunset paints the sky in flame
Shadows dance on every name
Canyons hum a timeless theme
In this land where silence screams

[bridge]
Steel tracks once crossed the plain
Now ghosts of trains remain
But the wind still tells the tale
Of Badlands' rugged trail

[verse]
Night falls with stars so bright
Moonlight on the canyon's height
Whispers of the old and right
In this place, we find our fight
```
17. Mesa Verde National Park
```
[verse]
Ancient stones in silent rows
Echoes of the Pueblo's prose
Cliff dwellings carved with care
Whispers of a timeless prayer

[chorus]
Swing low where the canyon breathes
Jazz notes rise from ancient wrecks
In Mesa Verde's shadowed grace
We find the rhythm of the place

[verse]
Dance of shadows on the wall
Stories etched in stone and all
The wind sings through the narrow trails
A jazz refrain that never fails

[bridge]
Steel drums echo in the night
Ghostly wails, a sacred right
The canyon hums a low refrain
In Mesa's heart, we find our name

[verse]
Sunset paints the red rock high
Canyons sing with ancient sigh
Every note a tale of stone
In this land where jazz is known

Let the music guide your way
Through the cliffs and canyon day
Mesa Verde's jazz will play
A melody that won't decay

[verse]
Desert winds whisper through the dunes
Heat waves shimmer under the sun
Canyons deep and silence loud
Echoes of the past are found

In the heart of the desert's embrace
Where the sun burns with relentless grace
Jazz notes rise on the hot air
A melody that won't disappear

[verse]
Rocks stand tall in golden light
Shadows dance in the night
Stars above, a shimmering sea
Guiding travelers through the heat

[bridge]
The desert sings in every tone
A symphony of sand and stone
Jazz rhythms echo through the land
In Death Valley's timeless hand

[verse]
Cacti bloom with vibrant hue
Against the backdrop of the blue
Every note a tale of sand
A jazz song in this vast expanse

[outro]
So let the desert's rhythm play
Underneath the blazing day
Jazz and heat, a perfect blend
In Death Valley's endless end

[verse]
Neon lights they flicker bright
City hums in dead of night
Rhythms pulse through concrete veins
Lost in echoes of refrains

[verse]
Bassline groovin' in my chest
Heartbeats match the city's zest
Electric whispers fill the air
Synthesized dreams everywhere

[chorus]
Turn it up and let it flow
Feel the fire let it grow
In this rhythm we belong
Hear the night sing out our song

[verse]
Guitar strings they start to weep
Wake the soul from silent sleep
Every note a story told
In this night we're bold and gold

[bridge]
Voices blend in harmony
Lost in pure cacophony
Timeless echoes timeless cries
Soulful shouts beneath the skies

[verse]
Keyboard dances on the keys
Melodies on evening breeze
Catch the tune and hold it tight
In this moment we take flight

风格提示词为：
```

本次生成歌曲的成功率高很多，除了提示词无误，Ace Step本身生成爵士乐的成功率也远高于其它类型，个人认为原因是爵士乐相比其它流行音乐总体上作曲问题少很多，相比古典音乐形式更简单。另外歌词快慢较灵活，也有助于减少生成时出现的明显问题。

本部分歌曲的歌词如下：
1. Yellowstone National Park
```
[verse]
Geysers erupt in steamy dance
Bison roam through ancient trance
Wild rivers carve through stone
In Yellowstone's wild, untamed zone

[verse]
Mist from Old Faithful's faithful spray
Echoes of the past still stay
Tectonic tales in rock and fire
Jazz flows where the earth inspires

[chorus]
Let the rhythm of the land be heard
In every note, a story stirred
From Yellowstone's grand display
A jazz symphony of day

[verse]
Beneath the stars, the wolves howl low
In twilight's hush, the silence grows
Strings of sax and flute entwine
With nature's beat, we all align

[bridge]
The park's a song, both wild and free
A melody that sets you free
From geysers' breath to mountain's cry
Jazz echoes in the sky

[verse]
In every step, the earth resounds
With jazz that makes the heart pound
Yellowstone's tale is told
In rhythms bold and melodies of gold
```
2. Yosemite National Park
```
[verse]
Beneath the sequoias' towering grace
Where mist ascends in morning's embrace
Granite cliffs echo with ancient tales
Yosemite's heartbeat, a timeless tale

[chorus]
Let the jazz flow through the valley's breath
Where waterfalls cascade from above
In every note, the park comes alive
A symphony of nature's vibe

[verse]
El Capitan stands in silent pride
Its rock face carved by time and tide
Beneath the stars, the rivers sing
A melody that forever rings

[bridge]
The mist rolls in on Yosemite's breeze
A saxophone begins to tease
With every chord, the park takes flight
In jazz's rhythm, we unite

[verse]
Through the meadows where wildflowers bloom
The music sways in a gentle tune
Beneath the sky's vast, open dome
Yosemite's song is never done

[outro]
So let the jazz carry you high
Through Yosemite's granite sky
In every note, the park will stay
A timeless jazz-filled day
```
3. Grand Canyon National Park
```
[verse]
Red rocks rise in silent awe
Echoes of ancient winds blow
Canyons deep where stories sleep
Jazz notes drift on desert heat

[chorus]
Let the canyon sing its tale
In a rhythm that prevails
Through the ages, through the stone
A jazz melody is known

[verse]
Rivers carve through time's embrace
Saxophone hums in desert space
Every note a canyon's cry
Underneath the starry sky

[bridge]
Trumpet calls from distant peaks
Lost in echoes of the depths
Timeless beats, a soulful sound
In this vast and sacred ground

[verse]
Sunset paints the rock with gold
Jazz lingers where the wild is bold
Every chord a desert's song
A melody that belongs

Let the canyon's jazz be heard
In every note, in every word
A timeless tune, a lasting rhyme
In Grand Canyon's sacred time
```

Summit winds whisper through pine
Echoes of a jazz refrain
Beneath the stars we sway
To the rhythm of the day

[chorus]
Let the mountains sing their tune
In a syncopated groove
Every peak a saxophone
In this melody we move

[verse]
Snow-capped peaks touch the sky
A trumpet's call in the high
Meadow blooms in soft refrain
Nature's jazz in every strain

[bridge]
Bassline of the river's flow
Harmonies in the alpine glow
Timeless notes in the pines they play
Rocky Mountain's jazz today

[verse]
Hiking trails through the mist
A clarinet's gentle twist
Wildlife dances in the light
Jazz rhythms take flight

Let the mountains echo loud
In a swingin' rhythm proud
Rocky's song, a timeless tune
In this melody we're one

[verse]
Crimson cliffs rise high above
Echoes of the Virgin's love
Jazz notes flow through canyon air
A saxophone's soft refrain

[chorus]
Let the rock sing in a swingin' groove
Every spire a trumpet's cue
In this canyon's rhythm we move
Zion's jazz is bold and true

[verse]
Rivers carve through ancient stone
Drums of thunder softly moan
Bassline pulses with the flow
Of the Virgin River's slow

[bridge]
Harmonies rise on the wind
Lost in echoes of the canyon's mind
Timeless rhythms, wild and free
Soulful melodies beneath the sky

Guitar strings hum a sacred tune
Stories etched in red and blue
Every note a tale of grace
In this park we find our place

Let the music carry on
Through the canyons, bold and strong
Zion's jazz will never fade
In our hearts it's always made

Morning mist on Mount Desert
Seagulls cry in coastal quest
Acadia's tides, a gentle sway
Where ocean meets the sky today

Sail the winds through pine and stone
Echoes of the sea's own tone
In Acadia's arms we're free
A symphony of land and sea

[verse]
Cranberry bogs in autumn glow
Whispers of the past below
Every trail a story told
In Acadia's heart we're bold

[bridge]
Fog rolls in on Cadillac
Echoes of the old, the glad
Timeless echoes, timeless cries
Soulful shouts beneath the skies

Keyboard dances on the keys
Melodies on evening breeze
Catch the tune and hold it tight
In this moment we take flight

Acadia's song, a jazz refrain
Where nature's rhythm never fails
In every note, a lasting tale
Of mountains, sea, and wild trails
```

Misty mornings in the Smokies rise,
Whispers of the forest, a gentle surprise.
Tall pines sway with a rhythm so old,
In this land where the wild and the sacred are bold.

Let the music flow through the misty air,
Echoes of the past, we're everywhere.
With every note, the mountains sing,
A jazz melody in the heart of the spring.

[verse]
Beneath the canopy, shadows play,
A symphony of life in a hidden way.
The brook's soft lullaby,
Guiding the soul to the sky.

[bridge]
In the stillness, the saxophone cries,
A tale of the forest, where time flies.
Through the mist, we find our way,
In this jazz-filled land, we dance and play.

[verse]
The fog rolls in with a sultry tune,
A melody that's all its own.
Every step through the trees,
Is a rhythm that sets your soul free.

So let the music carry you high,
Through the Smokies' embrace, where dreams touch the sky.
In this jazz-filled land, we find our way,
A timeless song in the heart of the day.

Towering giants in sequoia's embrace
Ancient sentinels of time and space
Their bark like stories etched in rhyme

Swing low where the redwoods grow
Whispers of the canyon's flow
In this rhythm of earth and sky
Jazz meets the sequoia's cry

Kings Canyon's depths a symphony
Rocks and rivers in harmony
Sunlight filters through the trees
A melody of ancient ease

Bassline thumps where waterfalls cascade
Guitar strums through the canyon's shade
Every note a tale untold
In this land where legends hold

[verse]
Redwoods stretch to touch the sun
Jazz flows where the wild runs
Through the canyons deep and wide
A song of sequoia's pride

Let the rhythm carry you
Through the sequoia's hush
In the canyon's endless tune
Jazz meets nature's truth

Where legends live and dreams take shape
In every shadow, stories told
Of presidents who shaped this land of gold

Let the rhythm of the mountains play
Feel the soul beneath the day
In this melody we find our way
Through time and space, we sing today

Beneath the stars, a silent vow
To honor those who led us now
Each note a tribute, each chord a prayer
For freedom's song, we hold it dear

[bridge]
Whispers of the past still call
In every breeze that dances tall
Through ancient pines and rugged trails
We find our strength, we find our tales

[verse]
Jazz flows through the canyon's breath
A symphony of nature's depth
With every beat, a new refrain
Mount Rushmore's song, we sing again

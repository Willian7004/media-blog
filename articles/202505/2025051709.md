[verse]
Neon lights they flicker bright
City hums in dead of night
Rhythms pulse through concrete veins
Lost in echoes of refrains

[verse]
Bassline groovin' in my chest
Heartbeats match the city's zest
Electric whispers fill the air
Synthesized dreams everywhere

[chorus]
Turn it up and let it flow
Feel the fire let it grow
In this rhythm we belong
Hear the night sing out our song

[verse]
Guitar strings they start to weep
Wake the soul from silent sleep
Every note a story told
In this night we're bold and gold

[bridge]
Voices blend in harmony
Lost in pure cacophony
Timeless echoes timeless cries
Soulful shouts beneath the skies

[verse]
Keyboard dances on the keys
Melodies on evening breeze
Catch the tune and hold it tight
In this moment we take flight

本部分歌曲的歌词如下：
1. 花式滑板
```
[verse]
Concrete veins pulse with rebellion
Skateboard wheels scream on pavement
Riding high on gravity's call
Defying limits, breaking the wall

[chorus]
Grind the rails, feel the rush
Skateboard thrash in the dusk
Street art of speed and defiance
In this chaos we find our grace

[verse]
Ollies high, kickflips spin
Neon lights flash through the din
Every trick a battle cry
Against the world's cold reply

[bridge]
Beneath the city's neon glow
Skateboard rebels take control
No chains can hold us down
We ride the edge of town

[verse]
Curb stunts echo in the night
Skateboard dreams take flight
Through the streets we carve our name
In the concrete, we claim fame

[outro]
Ride the line, break the mold
Skateboard hearts never fold
In this metal, we belong
To the rhythm of the song
```
2. 花式单车
```
[verse]
Steel wheels spin on asphalt veins
Freestyle bikes defy the chains
Pedal through the neon night
Chasing speed in endless flight

[chorus]
Chain the gears, break the law
Cycling thrash in the raw
Street art of velocity and pain
In this chaos we claim our name

[verse]
BMX flips, no fear, no doubt
Wheels spin in the dead of night
Every trick a battle cry
Against the world's cold reply

[bridge]
Beneath the city's neon glow
Cyclists rebels take control
No chains can hold us down
We ride the edge of town

[verse]
Curb stunts echo in the night
Freestyle dreams take flight
Through the streets we carve our name
In the concrete, we claim fame

[outro]
Ride the line, break the mold
Cycling hearts never fold
In this metal, we belong
To the rhythm of the song
```
3. 花式滑雪
```
[verse]
Snowflakes fall like shattered glass
Mountain winds in silent pass
Skates carve through the frozen night
Frosty trails of pure delight

[verse]
Speed is born from icy veins
Racing down the mountain's reign
Crisp air bites with every breath
Chasing shadows, seeking death

[chorus]
Crash and burn in winter's flame
Ski the edge of danger's name
In this frost we find our way
Through the snow, we ride today

[verse]
Gates open to the void
Skating through the cold and loud
Every turn a deadly art
Frostbitten hearts take part

[bridge]
Voices rise in frozen hymn
Echoes lost in mountain's limb
Timeless cries beneath the sky
Skiing through the endless night

[verse]
Blades carve deep into the snow
Racing through the white below
Catching fire with every spin
In this cold, we're all within
```
4. 滑翔
```
[verse]
Wings unfold in sky of fire
Gravity's chains we dare to ignore
Wind screams through our veins
A thousand feet we soar

[chorus]
No ropes no strings no fear
We ride the edge of atmosphere
In freefall we find our power
Let the wind be our devour

[verse]
Clouds kiss our faces wild
Sunlight dances on the void
Every gust a battle cry
We conquer sky with pride

[bridge]
Silence screams in endless blue
A moment lost in flight's true hue
No ground below no ceiling above
We are the storm we prove

[chorus]
No ropes no strings no fear
We ride the edge of atmosphere
In freefall we find our power
Let the wind be our devour

[outro]
Wings fade into horizon's glow
A fleeting echo as we go
Through thunderclouds we'll ride again
Until the sky is ours to claim
```
5. 跑酷
```
[verse]
Concrete walls we defy
Every leap a deadly cry
Shadows dance in neon light
Our bodies break the night

[chorus]
No chains no ropes no fear
We crash through concrete sphere
In motion we find our power
Let the city be our devour

[verse]
Footfalls echo on the steel
Bare bones and adrenaline zeal
Every wall a challenge thrown
In this chaos we're reborn

[bridge]
Voices scream in rhythm
Lost in pure anarchy
Timeless echoes timeless cries
Soulful shouts beneath the skies

[chorus]
No chains no ropes no fear
We crash through concrete sphere
In motion we find our power
Let the city be our devour

[outro]
Grit your teeth and take the fall
In this moment we're all
Feral hearts in urban sprawl
Defying gravity's call
```
6. 攀岩
```
[verse]
Grip the stone with iron will
Scaling peaks where shadows spill
Fingers bleed through jagged veins
Defying gravity's reign

[chorus]
Climb higher, touch the sky
Crack the wall, break the lie
In this climb we find our fire
Rise above, reach for higher

[verse]
Boulders scream beneath my feet
Every hold a battle feat
Rock face echoes with my cry
Conquer heights, don't ask why

[bridge]
No fear in the climb's embrace
Each foothold a test of grace
Timeless struggle, endless fight
Scream into the mountain night

[chorus]
Climb higher, touch the sky
Crack the wall, break the lie
In this climb we find our fire
Rise above, reach for higher

[outro]
The summit calls, I'll ascend
Through pain and strength, I'll transcend
Rock climbing's heavy creed
A metal hymn to freedom
```

7. 冲浪
```
[verse]
Waves crash like a thousand drums
Salt in the air, we're never done
Board rides the storm with reckless pride
Chasing the horizon, no need to hide

[verse]
Tides roar through the midnight sky
Riding the crest where legends fly
Foam kisses the edge of night
We are the fire, we are the light

[chorus]
Ride the wave, let it scream
Feel the rush, break the scheme
In the chaos, we're free
Screaming through the sea

[verse]
Grip the board with iron will
Every crash a battle to win
Storms in our veins, we dare to fall
Reborn from the depths, we rise and crawl

[bridge]
The ocean roars, the sky ignites
We ride the edge of pure delight
No fear, no chains, just speed and flame
Soul on fire, we claim our name

[verse]
Winds howl through the crashing tide
Board cuts through the endless night
Every drop a battle cry
In the storm, we touch the sky
```
8. 沙板
```
[verse]
Dunes rise high beneath the sun
Sandboard slides on desert run
Winds howl loud in endless cries
Riding waves of shifting skies

[verse]
Blades carve through the golden sand
Heartbeats race with reckless demand
Desert echoes scream my name
Speed is all I've ever known

[chorus]
Crash into the dunes, feel the fire ignite
Sandboard screams as freedom flies
Through the storm we ride, no fear, no light
In this chaos, we take flight

[verse]
Footprints vanish in the dust
Every turn a test of trust
Sands shift fast, I'm chasing fate
Riding wild, I break the chain

[bridge]
No chains, no rules, just wind and sand
Screaming through the desert land
Eyes on the horizon, heart full of pain
Sandboard rides through endless rain

[verse]
Blades dig deep in shifting ground
Speed is all that's left to sound
Desert winds my only guide
In this rush, I'll never die
```
9. 越野摩托车
```
[verse]
Dust devils rise on roaring wheels
Engines scream through desert trails
Chrome and steel in midnight gleam
Chasing storms on twisted beams

[verse]
Gears grind loud in canyon winds
Tires bite the red dirt lines
Speed demons in wild pursuit
Racing shadows through the night

[chorus]
Rev it up and tear ahead
Through the fire let the chaos spread
In this steel we find our creed
Ride the edge where legends bleed

[verse]
Handlebars twist with reckless grace
Beneath the stars we carve our place
Every mile a battle won
On the asphalt we're undone

[bridge]
Skies ignite with engine roars
Wheels spin in endless hours
Fueled by grit and gasoline
We ride until the world's aligned

[verse]
Headlights cut through desert haze
Echoes of the wild remain
In every crash, every climb
We defy the laws of time
```
10. 极限直排轮
```
[verse]
Concrete veins pulse with speed
Wheels carve through the midnight feed
Steel blades slice through asphalt night
Adrenaline fuels our fight

[chorus]
Skate through the storm, no chains
Beneath the neon lights we reign
Concrete symphony of screams
In this chaos we redeem

[verse]
Footwork flows like liquid fire
Graffiti trails in midnight pyre
Every turn a death defying art
We ride the edge of dark

[bridge]
Wheels spin in electric rage
Beneath the city's shadowed cage
No fear, no law, just speed and steel
We're ghosts on concrete wheels

[outro]
Skate until the dawn breaks
In this metal heart we shakes
Through streets and shattered glass
We ride the rush of the past

[verse]
Blades scream on asphalt veins
Neon lights our guiding chains
Every crash a fleeting song
In this chaos we belong

[chorus]
Skate through the storm, no chains
Beneath the neon lights we reign
Concrete symphony of screams
In this chaos we redeem
```
11. 风筝冲浪
```
[verse]
Winds howl through the crashing waves
Sail the storm with fearless graves
Tethered to the sky's command
Ride the tempest, break the land

[verse]
Salt and sweat upon my skin
Chasing speed where danger wins
Kite soars in electric blue
Harnessing the wild and true

[chorus]
Rise with the wind, let it scream
Feel the rush, let it gleam
In this chaos we are free
Sailing through the storm's decree

[verse]
Currents pull, the board takes flight
Every turn a battle fight
Against the sea's relentless cry
We defy, we touch the sky

[bridge]
Voices lost in wind's embrace
Chasing horizons, no trace
Of fear or doubt, just pure delight
In the storm's fierce, blinding light

[verse]
Kite dances with the gale
Heartbeats sync with ocean's tale
No chains can hold us down
We ride the wave, we break the crown
```
12. 赛车
```
[verse]
Revving engines scream in tune
Gears grind under midnight moon
Speed demons chase the checkered flag
Burning tires, racing for the thrills of the track

[verse]
Nitro boost through asphalt veins
Heartbeats sync with engine chains
Chrome and steel in neon light
Chasing victory through the night

[chorus]
Hit the gas, let the world fade
In this race, we never fade
With every mile, we break the chain
Racing through the storm, we claim our name

[verse]
Checkered flag, the finish line
Speed kings fight for the prize divine
Every corner, every bend
A test of skill, a battle to the end

[bridge]
Screaming tires, smoke in the air
Chasing speed, no need to care
Through the curves, through the fire
Racing hearts never retire

[verse]
Engine roars, the track's our home
Speed and glory, we'll never roam
With the wind in our hair, we race
To the edge of time, we chase the blaze

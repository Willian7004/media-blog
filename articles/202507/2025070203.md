Here are 10 storyboard shots for "A woman wearing a suit dancing" in an office setting, focusing on varied angles, moods, and dance styles:

1.  **Shot (Close-Up - Low Angle):** A woman wearing a suit dancing with sharp, staccato heel clicks and ankle rolls, her polished shoes the focus against the polished office floor. Her reflection is visible beneath her.
2.  **Shot (Medium Shot - Over the Shoulder):** A woman wearing a suit dancing fluidly with her back to the camera, weaving between empty cubicles like a maze, her movements smooth and serpentine.
3.  **Shot (Wide Shot - High Angle):** A woman wearing a suit dancing exuberantly atop a large, empty conference table. Sunlight streams through the window, casting her long shadow across scattered papers.
4.  **Shot (Medium Close-Up - Dutch Angle):** A woman wearing a suit dancing with intricate hand movements and subtle body rolls while leaning against a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the city skyline. Her reflection dances with her.
5.  **Shot (Medium Shot - Eye Level):** A woman wearing a suit dancing playfully with an office swivel chair, spinning it, leaning on it, and using it as a prop for dips and turns near her desk.
6.  **Shot (Close-Up - Focus Pull):** A woman wearing a suit dancing with intense focus, sweat beading on her temple. The camera starts focused on her determined eyes, then pulls out to reveal her executing precise, powerful isolations in front of humming server racks.
7.  **Shot (Wide Shot - Static):** A woman wearing a suit dancing freely down a long, sterile office corridor under flickering fluorescent lights. Her silhouette grows larger as she approaches the camera with confident strides and leaps.
8.  **Shot (Medium Shot - Reflection):** A woman wearing a suit dancing with elegant, balletic movements solely visible in the dark reflection of a turned-off office window at night. The actual office behind her is dimly lit and empty.
9.  **Shot (Extreme Close-Up - Dynamic):** A woman wearing a suit dancing. Focus on her hands and wrists executing sharp, rhythmic snaps and intricate gestures inches away from the glowing buttons of a photocopier.
10. **Shot (Wide Shot - Panning):** A woman wearing a suit dancing with infectious joy near the elevator bank. She starts alone, but as the camera pans, it reveals colleagues cautiously joining in, shedding their formal stiffness as the dance spreads.

Each shot emphasizes the contrast between the formal suit and the expressive dance, utilizing the unique features and atmosphere of the office environment.

Here are 10 storyboard shots starting with "A woman wearing a dress dancing," set in a castle, using English descriptions:

1.  **Wide Shot:** A woman wearing a dress dancing alone in the center of a vast, sunlit castle ballroom. Dust motes float in the rays streaming through towering arched windows. Marble floors reflect her movements. (Focus: Establishing scale & isolation)
2.  **Low Angle Shot:** A woman wearing a dress dancing gracefully near a massive stone fireplace. The camera looks up, emphasizing the towering hearth, carved crests above, and her flowing skirt against the dark stone. (Focus: Grandeur, architecture)
3.  **Medium Shot (Tracking):** A woman wearing a dress dancing through a long, ornate castle corridor lined with suits of armor and tapestries. The camera smoothly tracks alongside her as she twirls past historical artifacts. (Focus: Movement through space, history)
4.  **Close-Up:** A woman wearing a dress dancing, her eyes closed, a serene smile on her face. The intricate lace detail on the bodice of her dress fills the lower part of the frame. Soft candlelight flickers on her skin. (Focus: Emotion, detail)
5.  **High Angle Shot:** A woman wearing a dress dancing in a secluded, moonlit castle courtyard garden. The camera looks down from a balcony, framing her amongst manicured hedges and a central fountain. (Focus: Seclusion, romantic atmosphere)
6.  **Over-the-Shoulder Shot:** A woman wearing a dress dancing, seen from behind as she moves towards a large, stained-glass window depicting a historical scene. The colored light from the window casts patterns on her dress and the floor. (Focus: Framing, light play)
7.  **Medium Shot (Dutch Angle):** A woman wearing a dress dancing playfully at the foot of a grand, curved stone staircase. The camera tilts slightly, adding dynamism to her spins and the imposing backdrop of the stairs. (Focus: Energy, architectural feature)
8.  **Reflection Shot:** A woman wearing a dress dancing, primarily seen reflected in a large, ornate, tarnished gold mirror hanging in a dimly lit castle library. Bookshelves line the walls behind the reflection. (Focus: Visual interest, mood)
9.  **Detail Shot (Feet & Skirt):** A woman wearing a dress dancing – the shot focuses tightly on her feet in delicate slippers and the swirling hem of her silk skirt brushing against the intricate patterns of a worn Persian rug in a castle salon. (Focus: Movement detail, texture)
10. **Extreme Long Shot:** A woman wearing a dress dancing as a small, elegant figure framed within the towering stone archway of a castle's grand entrance hall. The shot emphasizes the immense scale and shadowy depths of the hall around her, ending as she dips into a final curtsy, fading slightly into the darkness. (Focus: Scale, finale, atmosphere)

Each shot captures a different aspect of the dance, the woman's presence, and the diverse atmospheres within the castle setting.

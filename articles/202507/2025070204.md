Here are 10 distinct storyboard shots (panels), each starting with "A woman in swimwear dancing" on a beach:

1.  **Wide Establishing Shot:** A woman in swimwear dancing wildly, arms flung wide, kicking up sand near the water's edge at sunset. The vast, empty beach stretches behind her, painted orange and pink by the setting sun. (Focus: Freedom, scale, setting)
2.  **Low Angle Shot:** A woman in swimwear dancing barefoot in the shallow surf, seen from a low angle looking up. Silhouetted against the bright sky, water splashes dramatically around her ankles with each step. (Focus: Movement, silhouette, power)
3.  **Medium Shot - Joyful:** A woman in a bright bikini dancing with pure, unadulterated joy, laughing towards the camera. Sunlight glints off her damp skin and the turquoise water just behind her. (Focus: Emotion, energy, connection)
4.  **Close-Up on Feet:** A woman in swimwear dancing, focus tight on her feet rhythmically pressing into and swirling the wet, compacted sand near the shore. Small waves occasionally wash over them. (Focus: Rhythm, texture, grounding)
5.  **Overhead Shot (Drone Perspective):** A woman in swimwear dancing in intricate, swirling patterns on the smooth, damp sand left by the receding tide. Her shadow is long and distinct below her on the reflective surface. (Focus: Pattern, perspective, isolation)
6.  **Medium Long Shot - Interaction:** A woman in swimwear dancing playfully *with* a friend (also in swimwear). They hold hands, spin each other, and laugh amidst gentle waves. Palm trees frame the background. (Focus: Relationship, fun, shared experience)
7.  **Slow Motion Detail Shot:** A woman in swimwear dancing, captured in slow motion as she throws her head back, hair flying out in a cascade of water droplets against the bright blue sky and ocean backdrop. (Focus: Grace, detail, fluidity)
8.  **Dutch Angle - Dynamic:** A woman in swimwear dancing energetically on dry, hot sand dunes slightly back from the shore. The camera uses a slight Dutch angle, emphasizing the dynamic movement of her body against the slanted lines of the dunes and the horizon. (Focus: Energy, dynamism, unconventional angle)
9.  **Intimate Close-Up:** A woman in swimwear dancing slowly, eyes closed, lost in the music only she can hear. Focus is tight on her face and shoulders, the soft bokeh of the ocean waves blurred behind her. (Focus: Introspection, mood, serenity)
10. **Backlit Silhouette - Sunset:** A woman in swimwear dancing gracefully at the very edge of the water, perfectly silhouetted against the intense, fiery colors of the setting sun reflecting on the wet sand and ocean. (Focus: Beauty, mood, atmosphere, iconic imagery)
